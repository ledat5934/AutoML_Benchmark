  "competition_brief": "You are an expert programmer with years of experience in writing codes for machine learning (ML) tasks on Kaggle. Your goal is to write an end-to-end executable program that can solve the ML task based on the provided instructions. The user is trying to create a Python program for a supervised machine learning task. Your goal is to assist the user in creating the program. The user might provide the following information for the task: 1. A description of the input data: The input data is a single color image of a dog. 2. A description of the output data: The output is a probability distribution across 120 possible classes. Each class represents a specific dog breed. For each input image, the model must predict the probability that the dog belongs to each of the 120 breeds. 3. The task objective: For each given image of a dog, create a classifier to determine the dog's breed. This is a multi-class classification problem with 120 classes. 4. The evaluation metrics: The evaluation metric is Multi-Class Log Loss. 5. A description of the available files: - `train`: A folder file containing the training set of dog images. - `test`: A folder file containing the test set of dog images. - `labels.csv`: The main training metadata file. It contains two columns: `id` (which corresponds to the image filename) and `breed` (the correct breed label for that image). - `sample_submission.csv`: An example file showing the required submission format, which includes an `id` column and a probability column for each of the 120 breeds."
