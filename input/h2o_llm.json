  "competition_brief": "You are an expert programmer with years of experience in writing codes for machine learning (ML) tasks on Kaggle. Your goal is to write an end-to-end executable program that can solve the ML task based on the provided instructions. The user is trying to create a Python program for a supervised machine learning task. Your goal is to assist the user in creating the program. The user might provide the following information for the task: 1. A description of the input data:-- The input data for each sample consists of two text fields: - `Question`: The original prompt or question that was given to a language model. - `Response`: The text output that was generated by one of the language models in response to the `Question`. 2. A description of the output data:-- The output is a probability distribution across 7 possible classes. Each class corresponds to one of the 7 different LLM models that could have generated the `Response`. The final submission requires predicting the probability for each of the 7 models (target_0 to target_6). 3. The task objective:-- For each given pair of `Question` and `Response`, identify which of the 7 LLM models generated the `Response`. This is a multi-class classification task where the output is a set of probabilities for each class. 4. The evaluation metrics:-- The evaluation metric is Log Loss (logloss). A lower logloss score indicates a better-performing model. 5. A description of the available files:-- - `train.csv`: Contains the training data with three columns: `Question`, `Response`, and `target` (an integer from 0 to 6 indicating the correct model). - `test.csv`: Contains the test data with three columns: `id`, `Question`, and `Response`. The goal is to predict the target probabilities for these samples. - `sample_submission.csv`: An example submission file showing the required format, which includes an `id` column and 7 probability columns (`target_0` through `target_6`)"
