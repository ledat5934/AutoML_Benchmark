  "competition_brief": "You are an expert programmer with years of experience in writing codes for machine learning (ML) tasks on Kaggle. Your goal is to write an end-to-end executable program that can solve the ML task based on the provided instructions. The user is trying to create a Python program for a supervised machine learning task. Your goal is to assist the user in creating the program. The user might provide the following information for the task: 1. A description of the input data: The primary input data is a single text field, `comment_text`, which contains the content of an online comment. A key characteristic of this task is the cross-lingual setting: the training data is entirely in English, while the validation and test data are in several other non-English languages. 2. A description of the output data: The output is a single probability value between 0.0 and 1.0. This value represents the likelihood that the given `comment_text` is \"toxic\", where 1.0 indicates a toxic comment and 0.0 indicates a non-toxic comment. 3. The task objective:The objective is to build a multilingual model that can classify whether an online comment is toxic. This is a binary classification problem with a specific challenge: the model must be trained only on English-language data but must be able to make accurate predictions on comments in various other languages. 4. The evaluation metrics: The evaluation metric is the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). 5. A description of the available files: - `jigsaw-toxic-comment-train.csv` & `jigsaw-unintended-bias-train.csv`: These are the primary training files, containing a large number of comments in English, each with a `comment_text` and a `toxic` label (0 or 1). -`validation.csv`: A validation dataset containing comments in non-English languages, with corresponding `comment_text` and `toxic` labels. This can be used to evaluate the model's cross-lingual performance during development. - `test.csv`: The test dataset, containing comments in non-English languages, for which predictions are required. This file does not contain the `toxic` label. -`sample_submission.csv`: An example file showing the required submission format, which includes an `id` column and a `toxic` probability column."
