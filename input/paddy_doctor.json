  "competition_brief": "You are an expert programmer with years of experience in writing codes for machine learning (ML) tasks on Kaggle. Your goal is to write an end-to-end executable program that can solve the ML task based on the provided instructions. The user is trying to create a Python program for a supervised machine learning task. Your goal is to assist the user in creating the program. The user might provide the following information for the task: 1. A description of the input data:-- The input data is multimodal, consisting of an image of a paddy leaf and its associated tabular metadata. - Image Data:-A color photograph of a single paddy leaf. - Tabular Metadata: For each image, there are two additional features: `variety` (the name of the paddy variety) and `age` (the age of the paddy plant in days). 2. A description of the output data: The output is a single categorical label that identifies the condition of the paddy leaf. There are 10 possible classes: nine different disease categories and one 'normal' category for a healthy leaf. 3. The task objective: For each given sample (image and metadata), develop a model to accurately classify the paddy leaf into one of the ten possible classes (nine diseases or normal). This is a multi-class classification problem. 4. The evaluation metrics:The evaluation metric for this competition is categorization Accuracy. 5. A description of the available files: - `train.csv`: The main training metadata file. It contains the columns `image_id`, `label` (the target class), `variety`, and `age`. - `train_images/`: A directory containing 10,407 training images. The images are organized into sub-directories, with each sub-directory named after one of the ten target classes. The filenames correspond to the `image_id` in `train.csv`. - `test_images/`: A directory containing 3,469 test images for which predictions are required. - `sample_submission.csv`: An example file showing the required submission format, which includes `image_id` and `label`."
