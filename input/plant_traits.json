  "competition_brief": "You are an expert programmer with years of experience in writing codes for machine learning (ML) tasks on Kaggle. Your goal is to write an end-to-end executable program that can solve the ML task based on the provided instructions. The user is trying to create a Python program for a supervised machine learning task. Your goal is to assist the user in creating the program. The user might provide the following information for the task: 1. A description of the input data:The input data is multimodal, consisting of two main types for each sample: - Image Data: A crowd-sourced photograph of a plant (`.jpeg`). -Tabular Ancillary Data: A set of geographical and environmental features associated with the image's location. This includes climate data (WORLDCLIM), soil data (SOIL), and multi-temporal satellite data (MODIS, VOD). 2. A description of the output data:The output consists of 6 continuous numerical values. Each value is a prediction for one of the 6 vital plant traits (e.g., X1080, X50, etc.), representing properties like leaf area or plant height. 3. The task objective: For each sample, predict the values for all 6 plant traits based on the plant image and its associated ancillary data. This is a multi-output regression task that requires a multi-modal model to handle both image and tabular inputs. 4. The evaluation metrics: The evaluation metric is the mean R-squared (R2) score, averaged over all 6 predicted traits. 5. A description of the available files: - `train.csv`: Contains the training data. For each `id`, it includes the target values for the 6 plant traits (columns named `X[*]_mean`) and all the ancillary tabular data (columns like `WORLDCLIM_BIO[*]`, `SOIL_[*]`, etc.). -`test.csv`: Contains the ancillary tabular data for the test set. It does not contain the target trait values. - `train_images/`: A directory containing the training images, with filenames corresponding to the `id` in `train.csv`. -`test_images/`: A directory containing the test images. - `target_name_meta.csv`: A helper file providing the full names and descriptions for each trait ID. - `sample_submission.csv`: An example file showing the required submission format, which includes an `id` column and a prediction column for each of the 6 traits."
