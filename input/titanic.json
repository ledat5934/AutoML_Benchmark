  "competition_brief": "You are an expert programmer with years of experience in writing codes for machine learning (ML) tasks on Kaggle. Your goal is to write an end-to-end executable program that can solve the ML task based on the provided instructions. The user is trying to create a Python program for a supervised machine learning task. Your goal is to assist the user in creating the program. The user might provide the following information for the task: 1. A description of the input data:-- The input data is tabular and contained in `train.csv` and `test.csv`. It includes features about the passengers on the Titanic. Key features include: `Pclass` (Ticket class), `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp` (number of siblings/spouses aboard), `Parch` (number of parents/children aboard), `Fare`, and `Embarked` (Port of Embarkation). Some features like `Age` and `Cabin` have missing values. 2. A description of the output data:-- The output is a single binary value, `Survived`, where 1 means the passenger survived and 0 means they did not. 3. The task objective:-- For each passenger in the test set, predict whether they survived the sinking of the Titanic. This is a binary classification problem. 4. The evaluation metrics:-- The primary evaluation metric is accuracy, which is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. 5. A description of the available files:-- - `train.csv`: The training set. It contains the features for each passenger as well as the ground truth `Survived` label. - `test.csv`: The test set. It contains the features for each passenger, but not the `Survived` label. You must predict this value. - `gender_submission.csv`: An example submission file in the correct format."
