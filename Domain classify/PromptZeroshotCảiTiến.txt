You are an expert programmer with years of experience in writing codes for machine learning (ML) tasks on Kaggle. Your goal is to write an end-to-end executable program that can solve the ML task based on the provided instructions. The user is trying to create a Python program for a supervised machine learning task. Your goal is to assist the user in creating the program. The user might provide the following information for the task:

1. A description of the input data:-- The input data for each sample consists of 1 text fields:

- `Title`: The title of the paper.

2. A description of the output data:-- The output is a one of the 4 possible classes. Each class corresponds to one of the 4 different domain

3. The task objective:-- For each given `Title`, identify which of the 4 domain. This is a multi-class classification task where the output is a set of class.

4. The evaluation metrics:-- The evaluation metric is Log Loss (logloss). A lower logloss score indicates a better-performing model.

5. A description of the available files:--

- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with three columns: `Title`, `Domain`

6. Link to the data files:/content/train.csv

split the train to evaluate by these folowing metrics: accuracy log_loss f1_macro f1_weighted roc_auc_ovr roc_auc_ovr_weighted
