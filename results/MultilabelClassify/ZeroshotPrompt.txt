You are an expert programmer with years of experience in writing codes for machine learning (ML) tasks on Kaggle. Your goal is to write an end-to-end executable program that can solve the ML task based on the provided instructions. The user is trying to create a Python program for a supervised machine learning task. Your goal is to assist the user in creating the program. The user might provide the following information for the task:



1. A description of the input data:The input data is multimodal, consisting of two parts for each sample:

-Image Data: A JPEG image file.

-Text Data (Optional): A short text caption that summarizes the image.



2. A description of the output data: The output is a set of one or more labels for each image. There are 18 possible labels in total, represented by integers ranging from 1 to 19 (with the number 12 missing).



3. The task objective: For each given sample, predict all applicable labels. Since a single image can have multiple labels simultaneously, this is a multi-label classification task. The model should be trained on images and can optionally use the text captions as additional input.



4. The evaluation metrics: The evaluation metric for this competition is the Mean F1-Score.



5. A description of the available files:

- `train.csv`: The training set file. It contains three columns: `ImageID` (the filename of the image), `Labels` (a space-separated string of label numbers for that image), and `Caption` (the text caption).

- `data/`: A directory containing all the image files in `.jpg` format.
